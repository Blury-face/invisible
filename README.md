# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Invisibility Cloak with Python & OpenCV

Turn yourself invisible with the magic of computer vision! This project uses OpenCV to simulate an **invisibility cloak** effect just like in the Harry Potter movies! üß£‚ú®

---

## üöÄ Features

* Real-time video processing
* Black color cloak invisibility
* Simple and lightweight
* Fun and magical experience!

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. Capture the background frame.
2. Detect black color regions in each frame (cloak).
3. Replace detected regions with the saved background.
4. Display the resulting output with the "invisibility" effect.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è When you run the script, leave the screen empty or showing only the background for the first **2‚Äì3 seconds** to let the program capture a clean background frame.

---

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python 3.x
* OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
* NumPy
* Time (built-in module)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Run in VS Code

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open the folder containing the `invisibility_cloak.py` file.
3. Make sure you have the Python extension installed in VS Code.
4. Open the terminal in VS Code (\`Ctrl + \`\`).
5. Run the script:

```bash
python3 invisible.py
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è After running, give the program 2‚Äì3 seconds with the screen clear so it can capture your background frame.
> AND ALSO USE BRIGHT LIGHT INFRONT OF YOUUU FOR BETTER RESULTS
> THIS ONLY WORKS WITH BLACK COLOR YOU WILL BE VISIBLE BUT THE BLACK YOU ARE HOLDING OR WEARING WILL BE INVISIBLE

That's it! The script will launch your webcam and start the invisibility effect.
